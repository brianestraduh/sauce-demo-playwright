# sauce-demo-playwright
This Project show cases my ability to create a test Automation Framework using Playwright
the following are important features supported,
  - multi environment  (local/prod) using DOTENV URL/USERNAME/PASSWORD dynamically change depending on npm command selected for the same set of tests
  - Authorization/Setup Project runs before the E2E test Suite saving time/resources by logging in ONLY once
  - Continuous integration using GIT ACTION ran using local .env file parameters
  - Use Page Object Fixtures (pom-test.ts)to organize POM files (pages) making test files clean and eliminating repeated code

  DM me with any questions THANKS!
